# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator*

**Cute Tippy** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Farhene Sultana**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] I researched to make the title of the app be a cute specific font and size style as well as changing the color of the bar.

## Notes

The video walkthrough helped a lot. 
However, I spent a great deal of time trying to figure out how to do the github setup because when I clicked "next" after making the repository it made the new repository, yet it did not put in the files from my local folder. Therefore, I had to import the files manually to do this. Another challenge was dealing with the layout, but I found out that for now I have to stick with one iPhone model that works best for me. 
I plan on doing more in the time being. 
For now, I wanted to submit the required features for the app.
